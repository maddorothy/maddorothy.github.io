My name is Dorothy Madera. I'm learning web development _on my own_. 
If that isn't a big enough task to take on, I'm also a stay-at-home-mom.

I started this journey knowing it'd be tough, but I'm not a quitter. 
If you want to read more about my accomplishments, challeges, and everything else, check out my [blog](https://maddorothy.github.io).

I have been away from my blog for a while longer than expected. I've still be working, but maybe not as hard as I would have liked.

It's Week 16, Day 2 of my journey. I am officially 4 months in.

I am still working on JavaScript. I have tried to go slow and really understand before moving on to the next topic. I've also used a few platforms to help learn. I've used LinkedIn Learning, The Odin Project, started Coderslang, checked out a couple books. I almost feel stuck or paralyzed. But I know it's just that I've lost focus.

I started a free Cloud 101 course of Coursera. I have one more "week" of that before I finish,

I applied for a scholarship to take an IT Tech Support Certificate program thorugh Coursera. I found it through The Mom Project and it's hosted by Career Circle. It looks promising. It starts on November 22nd. I'll finish with a certificate, hopefully be able to land a job with it, and can still continue elarning web development. I really just want to get my foot in the door somewhere and learn on the job. I do better by applying my learning.

I have also spent far too much time trying to figure out horw to move my blog from Blogger to GitHub. I want to be able to put all of my projects on GitHub so that proscpective employers can see my work. I also want to host my blog through GitHub pages. GitHub isn't as straightforward as I thought it was, so it's been a long learning process. I fianlly found a great YouTube playlist on Jekyll by Mike Dane which is exactly what I've been needing. He breaks down the whole process & explains everything well. I watched his course on MySQL as part of the training I did a while back & liked his teaching style. I'm currently creating this post directly in VS Code to be added to my site.

Let's see... what else..?

I made a list today of everything that I have going on or that I have coming up.

Okay, so I also started learning JavaScript on OneMonth.com. I got through about a week of the material, so I need to get back on track there.

Lastly, I also applied for a Web Development Bootcamp through Practicum. This one was found through Women Who Code. Practicum selects I think 6 people per month to go through one of their bootcamps. I have to finish the Intro Week of the course before I'm eligible, but something was up with the website. I'll have to go back and try again.

Whew! That was a lot.
I think I felt like I haven't been up to much, but that's most likely because I haven't finished anything and have nothing to show for what I've been up to.

Oh! Scratch that. I did complete a workshop hosted by Datastax on Vue,js & Typescript. We built a web app card game. It was a good intro to those tools. And I got something to show for it: a LinkedIn badge for my profile. I signed up for a NoSQL Databases Workshop in a couple days, too.

In summary, I've started a lot of things & need to buckle down & get some finished!

The sooner the better because my husband is getting deployed in a couple weeks and it'll just be me taking care of the kids, animals, house, and myself. It'll be fine.

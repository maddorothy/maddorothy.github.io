Today I finished the CSS Essential Learning on LinkedIn Learning üëç That makes 3 certificates on my profile.

The next item on my to-do list is the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp. 

It's about to be 2PM. The kids and I are headed to school around 3PM to "Meet the Teacher", so I have less than an hour to do some work. Also, the baby just woke up from her nap. I'd been holding her while I finished the CSS course & I put her down to type this out. We'll see how long big sister can entertain her before she wants Mommy...

Most progress made today was mostly downloading programs I'll need & gathering all of the many resources I've found. 

- I was tired of having 10 tabs open, so I created an Excel spreadsheet to keep all of the resources I've come across thus far
- completed some of The Odin Project: more on the command line
- joined a 2 week SQL mentorship hosted by a generous woman in one of my Facebook groups
  * joined a Facebook page dedicated to it 
  * started to download the SQL softwares, but it's late. Will do tomorrow

My husband is off on Mondays & I spend most of the day with him & the kids. Mondays are not my most productive days. Hopefully I'm able to focus & put in some more meaningful work tomorrow. Until then.

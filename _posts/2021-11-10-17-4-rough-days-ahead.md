I __just__ completed the Coursera Cloud Basics course! It was actually pretty easy to get through even with no knowledge of the Cloud. I added the certificate to my LinkedIn too.

Next on my To Do list is to complete the Practicum Intro WebDev Course. There's a Zoom meeting or Code Along thing tomorrow for it, so I'll try to get through as much as I can tonight. It should go pretty quickly since it should be more like a review of HTML & CSS. 

When the eldest gets home from school, we have a couple things to do & I _should_ go to the gym. I don't know if I will though... I really want to catch up on all this work. My husband left today for his deployment & I tried to spend as much time with him these last few days. He's only a few hours away, but it's going to be a big change to not see his face every day. I know I'm going to struggle with learning, holding down the fort, mothering, & mainitaining myself. I know it's going to be a rough few months. But I know I will be mindful & not allow myself to get bogged down. I can do it.

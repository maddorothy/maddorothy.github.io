Whoa! It's been a minute! 

The last time I was here, I left an update about adding the CSS badge on my Linkedin profile. Since then, I've added 3 more credentials: SQL (Basic) & CSS from HackerRank, and the Responsive Web Design certificate from freeCodeCamp! The FCC certificate was a long one, but I finally finished. I created a few projects through that certificate, but still want to update & clean them up. 

Most recently, I've started learning JavaScript. Way back when, I took an online computer science class & JavaScript just did not click for me. I've been reluctant to start learning it now because I feel like I'm still not going to get it and will fail. But I started. And there's no going back now. I'm actually going through FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course as well as The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics (as part of the Foundations path). Once I finish both of those, I'll have 8 projects using Javascript to add to my portfolio. 

I had stopped focusing on TOP for a while, but started back up & learning some Git basics. I want to upload all of the projects I've done so far into my GitHub pages so that they'll be accessible. Right now, they just live on my computer and in CodePen. Then I can also add any future projects there and I'll have a well-rounded portfolio. So that's on my to-do list.    

My main focus right now is JavaScript though. I've given myself 1 month to finish all of the material on The Odin Project + freeCodeCamp AND finish all 8 projects. When I lay it out in a "I need to do this amount of work for this number of days and complete each project within this many days", it seems super doable.

>Being a mom & doing all of this is hard. Some days I have a ton of energy - I'm able to be a present, interactive mother, clean & organize everything, give my body time to move as well as relax, & I feel so productive. Other days coffee doesn't work at all & I need to sleep in & maybe also nap when Lily does. But I try to listen to what my body needs & I think that's what matters. Lily is getting closer to walking every day. I try to teach her something new each day. Joy started soccer. We do book clubs & yoga classes together. Sometimes we pick up fast food on the way home & watch a movie together. At the end of the day, I feel like I'm doing the best I can with what I have been given. I look to the faces of my children & see that I am right. ðŸ˜Œ

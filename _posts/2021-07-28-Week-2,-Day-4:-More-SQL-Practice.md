title: "Week 2, Day 4: More SQL Practice"
tags: [FreeCodeCamp,SQL,]
---

The baby is napping and I'm getting some work done. 

Yesterday I was able to do some practice with SQL as I followed along with the FreeCodeCamp course. It's been pretty easy to get the hang of so far. 

Today I've watched 3 more video lessons & I have 3 more to knock out before tonight's "class" where we'll go through the material together. The classes have been helpful because sometimes the host shares tips that I wouldn't have known about otherwise or someone asks a question that I didn't know I needed the answer to. 

Originally, right before I joined this short SQL course, I told myself I was going to stick with The Odin Project. I had been getting sidetracked by so may resources & wasn't making any progress. Then I stumbled upon this & decided "It's only a couple weeks & I'll need it eventually." I don't have any regrets!

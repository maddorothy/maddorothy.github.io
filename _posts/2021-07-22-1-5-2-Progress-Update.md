First of all, last night I caught up on a SQL course. It's a mentorship/training through a Facebook group & we're following the course from FreeCodeCamp. A (very generous) Facebook group member offered to help others run through the course to get started with coding. A lot of times, the hardest part is starting, so the goal is to help other women get past that hump. It's 3 days a week for just 2 weeks. We've completed 2 days so far. I need to go through the video on the course website to prepare for our next Zoom meeting tomorrow evening. 

Today I reviewed the command line and set up Git as part of The Odin Project. I learned more about Git & GitHub.

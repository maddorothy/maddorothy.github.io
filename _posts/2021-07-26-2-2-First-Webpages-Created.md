Yesterday I created my first 2 webpages! 

I started a free "7 day" html/css course on [OneMonth.com](https://onemonth.com) while we were driving around on Saturday. Yesterday I wanted to try what I'd learned, but we were still mostly out of the house, driving around, & I don't usually take my computer with me. I downloaded an app called Koder where I was able to create a webpage from scratch & start creating another webpage. When we got home, I was able to finish the second one & even though it's really basic & the majority was done for me, I am pretty proud of myself. It's a major checkpoint on this journey.

Today I had a bunch of yard work to catch up on, and I did some "work" work, so I didn't really get any time to learn or practice anything. We went to the gym & lately I've been listening to the OneMonth podcast, "Learn to Code". I've listened to a handful of episodes & they've had some good info & tips. 

Later, I had another SQL "class". I didn't do more of the FreeCodeCamp course though, so I didn't know what was going on. I just followed along. When the class was over, I was able to fiddle with mySQL Workbench for a few minutes. I was having trouble getting the tables I was creating to be located in the database I'd just created. They kept showing up in sysadmin. I realized I needed to click on the new database to select it, drop the tables I'd already created, & recreate them in the new one. It worked, I counted it as a win, & took a break to hang with the baby.

I was intending to do a little learning before I call it a night, but I'm falling asleep as I write, so I'm calling it a night. Until tomorrow.
